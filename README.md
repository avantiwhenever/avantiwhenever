# ABOUT ME
- I am a Software Engineer by profession with a focus on creating and thriving in diverse workforces.
- Experience: 7+ years
- Worked in Domains: E-commerce, Computer software, Finance, Human Resources, Restaurant, Search Engine
- Masters in Computer Science @ Northeastern University, Boston (Class of 2016) 3.79/4 GPA
- Major: Software Engineering
- I am working on the search platform for Wayfair. I am also a Team Lead where my job is to plan, design and develop projects to make the system scalable and reliable while working with 3 people on the team as well as cross team collaboration.
- I actively develop in java and collaborate with different teams like SRE and search stakeholders to make sure projects are helping to make a positive customer impact.
- I have designed and developed REST API to cater to the search user base and act as a `Search as a Platform` service which can allow us to move towards elastic search and different flavors of Solr without affecting the end use behaviour aka framework agnostic search engine.
- Previously I have designed and developed new pipeline to run spark jobs for Toast’s first data analytics platform resulting in 90% improvement in time for reports processing. I have also developed REST apis as part of my job and worked on scaling them.
- I have an ability to solve complex problems in the production environment and thrive on challenges which lead me to receive many recommendations from my peers and project managers.
- I have built scalable systems to handle the load of millions of trades for the derivatives market of NSE
As an agile practitioner I have led many real life web based projects to success while at Northeastern University i.e MBTA group orders automation and Social networking for project feed 1010.
- At VMWARE I worked on enterprise class disaster recovery projects and won poster sessions for the Availability Zones project.
- Throughout my career I have worked with self-organizing teams varying in sizes from 2 to 20 people.
- I have always maintained code quality of projects using continuous integration tools and code reviews.
- I have also contributed to a paper on Programming Models for Distributed Computing: Futures and promises.
